# BCFparse-Reporter
 This Python program was developed for parsing files generated by the suite of bioinformatic tools BCFtools (https://github.com/samtools/bcftools), particularly by the *stats* command. Its purpose is to generate assimilable information (i.e. text files and plots) from specific sections of a *vchk* file.
