# BCFparse-Reporter
 This Python program was developed for parsing files generated by the suite of bioinformatic tools BCFtools (https://github.com/samtools/bcftools), particularly by the *stats* command. Its purpose is to generate assimilable information (i.e. text files and graphs) from specific sections of a *vchk* file.

## Input
* The input file should be a file generated with BCFtools-stats with a **.vchk** extension (examples can be found inside `Test files`).

## Output
* A text file containing data extracted from the *vchk* file based on the region (e.g. *tstv*) specified by the user.

* A PNG file with a graphical representation (e.g. bar chart) based on the data present in the text file. 

* Additionally, the program displays the *Summary numbers* section of the *vchk* file directly in the command line interface.

## Usage 
To run the program, users must enter the input file’s name, the output directory’s name, and the argument/s. These arguments (see List of parameters table) specify which sections of the *vchk* file to parse. Users have the option to specify one or multiple arguments, or none at all. As this is a multimodular program, only the primary script (*mainfunction.py*) needs to be run on the command line since it functions as the program’s starting point.

```python mainfunction.py input_file.vchk output_folder_name -argument_flag```

## Examples
Here’s an example demonstrating how the program can be run to parse only the *tstv* region from a *vchk* file:

```python mainfunction.py data1.vchk data1files -tstv```

This example is for parsing two regions of the *vchk* file:

```python mainfunction.py data1.vchk data1files -tstv -sis```
 
This example will only display the *Summary numbers* section in the command line as no arguments were specified:

```python mainfunction.py data1.vchk data1files```
