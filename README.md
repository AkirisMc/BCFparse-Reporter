# BCFparse-Reporter
 This Python program was developed for parsing files generated by the suite of bioinformatic tools BCFtools (https://github.com/samtools/bcftools), particularly by the *stats* command. Its purpose is to generate assimilable information (i.e. text files and graphs) from specific sections of a *vchk* file.

## Input
* The input file should be a file generated with BCFtools-stats with a **.vchk** extension (examples can be found inside `Test files`).

## Output
* A text file containing data extracted from the *vchk* file based on the region (e.g. *tstv*) specified by the user.

* A PNG file with a graphical representation (e.g. bar chart) based on the data present in the text file. 

* Additionally, the program displays the *Summary numbers* section of the *vchk* file directly in the command line interface.
